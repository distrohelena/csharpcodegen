# C# to TypeScript

Features
- BinaryReader/BinaryWriter
- MemoryStream
- Delegates (w/ Generics support)
- Function overload
- Classes inside classes
- Multiple constructors
- Multiple functions with same name
- (some) C# 12 features
- Pass argument by out/ref 
    - Dynamically creates an object that is passed to the method, then assigns back to the value name that was passed. 

.NET Library
System
    - Action<T...>
    - DateTime
    - Guid
    - NotSupportedException
    - TimeSpan
System.Collections.Concurrent
    - ConcurrentDictionary<Key, Value>
System.Collections.Generic
    - Dictionary<Key, Value>
    - List<T>
    - SortedList<T>
System.Drawing
    - Rectangle

Not Implemented
- Function arguments with same name as classes variables
    - A bit harder
- No constructor creation (argument-less)
- .Invoke() on delegates
- Class Functions with Arrow declaration
- Reflection (but it's getting there)
- Generic classes with shared name (i.e. RequestResult and RequestResult<T>)
- Override generic (i.e. public class ListData : List<Data> { } )
- Class inside class with generic parameters (so base class is <T>, but subclass is not)
- Static functions with generic parameters
    - TypeScript does not natively support this
    - There are workarounds but nothing implemented
- Tuples (public (string key, int value) MethodName())
- In-line out keyword (just lazy not hard to implement)
